## Progress Report - Slack Integration

### Current Status
- Basic agent infrastructure is working (Brain, Modules, Chains)
- Slack bot token is configured and working
- Socket Mode is enabled in the Slack App settings

### Issues Encountered
1. **Socket Mode Connection Issue**
   - Error: Missing scope `connections:write`
   - Current token shows `app_configurations:write` instead
   - Multiple attempts to resolve:
     - Generated new app-level tokens with `connections:write` scope
     - Regenerated tokens multiple times
     - Added all necessary bot scopes:
       - `app_mentions:read`
       - `chat:write`
       - `im:history`
       - `im:write`
       - `channels:history`
       - `channels:read`
       - `groups:history`
       - `groups:read`
       - `mpim:history`
       - `mpim:write`
     - Reinstalled app multiple times

### Next Steps
1. Investigate why the `connections:write` scope is not being recognized despite being added
2. Consider alternative approaches to Socket Mode implementation
3. Review Slack SDK documentation for potential version-specific issues
4. Consider implementing a non-Socket Mode fallback option
