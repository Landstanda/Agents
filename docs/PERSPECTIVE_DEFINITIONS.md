## Perspective Interaction

### Decision Making Process
1. Each perspective evaluates tasks independently
2. Brain aggregates perspective inputs
3. Weighted decision making based on context
4. Continuous feedback loop for improvement

### Conflict Resolution
- Priority matrix for competing perspectives
- Context-based weighting
- Business impact as tiebreaker
- Escalation to human when needed

### Learning & Adaptation
- Perspectives evolve based on outcomes
- Performance metrics tracking
- Regular evaluation of effectiveness
- Adjustment of weights and priorities

## Implementation Notes
- Perspectives should be implemented as separate AI models
- Each perspective maintains its own state and learning
- Perspectives can be updated independently
- New perspectives can be added as needed
- Custom perspectives can be created for specific business needs

## Future Enhancements
- Machine learning for perspective weighting
- Dynamic perspective creation
- Industry-specific perspectives
- Customizable perspective parameters
- Integration with external data sources
